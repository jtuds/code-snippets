We say 'Hello' and meet for a nice chat.
You let us know what you need and even fill in New Site Questionnaire if you like.
After establishing your needs, we then start to work on a template for your site.
Next, you are welcome to pass on your content by hand or by email. Feel free to use our Content Form for this to help your organise what you want on each page of your website..
After we have all the bits we need, we then mix it all together and your site is born.
Redinko, does some testing here and there. Plus, we fix any issues.
We then keep an eye on things so you are a happy customer.
